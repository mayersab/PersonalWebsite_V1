Through building this project, my thought process in how to think of developing react based applications was strengthened. In the future Iâ€™d like to improve this project by utilizing functional components, hooks, and form validation.',

This app leveraged the use of module bundling with webpack to organize code and NPM scripts to automate parts of the development process. In the future, I'd like to improve upon this app by adding in an edit feature as well as converting it into React based project.`,
